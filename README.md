# Big_Data_Hollywood_Analytic
A Big Data fueled Literary Onomastic and Gender Based Analysis of Hollywood
This project aims to study society by using movies and TV shows to perform distinct but related analytics. A central aim is to 
analyze the cast of movies and television over the past hundred years and find the numerical disparities of females being cast 
on a year to year basis as compared to their male counterparts. While gender equality is always deemed as how many important 
roles women are cast in as opposed to men, we are trying to approach this from a different angle. The ultimate aim is to see 
how many “actresses” are cast in a role v/s how many “actors” have a role in the same year. Apart from gender statistics, we 
aim to find a correlation between the names assigned to movie characters and the names that the American public at large gave 
to their children. A last analytic is aimed at finding how the huge number of end products of the movie industry are received 
by both the genders, in terms of most liked genres. We also try to find shifts or constants in these patterns over the century. 
Movie historians, Film Studies majors and Cultural Scientists will be typical users. Apart from these, people who study about 
society at large will be able to derive a variety of answers from this analytic.
